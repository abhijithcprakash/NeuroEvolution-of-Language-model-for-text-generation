I developed a framework that leverages neuroevolution to automatically evolve the most optimal language model for text generation, eliminating the need for manual model design and hyperparameter tuning. This system uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize the architecture and parameters of neural networks, allowing it to adapt and improve over time, based on predefined performance metrics. The process begins by defining a range of possible parameters for the language model, such as the number of layers, units per layer, activation functions, and learning rates. Through the process of neuroevolution, the system explores these combinations, evaluates the performance of each candidate model, and evolves towards the best configuration for the given task. This approach significantly reduces the time and expertise needed for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
